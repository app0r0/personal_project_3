            <h2>🚫 The Problem with Traditional Study Methods</h2>
            <p>
              Traditional studying often feels overwhelming:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>📚 25-minute Pomodoro sessions feel too long</li>
              <li>😫 Maintaining focus becomes exhausting</li>
              <li>📅 Finding large time blocks is impossible</li>
              <li>🏃 Busy schedules leave no room for study</li>
            </ul>
            <p>But what if there was a better way? 🌟</p>

            <h2>🎉 The 1-Minute Revolution: Why It Works</h2>
            <p>
              🧪 Scientific research shows that the biggest hurdle in studying isn't the studying itself—it's getting started. LearnLooper's 1-minute timer tackles this problem head-on!

            <h3>🧠 Breaking the Psychological Barrier</h3>
            <p>
              When you tell yourself "just one minute," your brain doesn't activate its usual resistance to studying. This psychological hack makes it significantly easier to begin your study session! ✨
            </p>

            <h3>🔄 Leveraging the Momentum Effect</h3>
            <p>
              Here's the interesting part: Once you start studying, you're likely to continue beyond that initial minute. This phenomenon, known as behavioral momentum, powers up your study sessions! 💪
